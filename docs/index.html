It dates back to 2008 when Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous person, outlined the contents in a white paper, then releasing Bitcoin to the public in 2009. In the late 2010, other similar forms of cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin appeared as well. Alongside the appearance of other crypto currencies, some of the first exchanges using Bitcoin began.</p><h2 id="2012">2<!-- -->0<!-- -->1<!-- -->2</h2><p>WordPress became the first major merchant to accept payment in Bitcoin. Popular cryptocurrency soon began to be accepted as a legitimate method of payment.</p><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h1 id="how-is-crypto-currency-different-from-stocks?">How is crypto currency different from stocks?</h1><p>The primary different between cryptocurrency and stocks is that when you buy crypto, you own a certain amount of that digital currency. It may be possible to use Crypto in transactions as easily as other currencies in the near future, but today it’s primarily a store of value that you can hold onto or sell. Stocks on the other hand are offered by companies as equity or ownership in that company.</p><p>Both crypto and stocks can increase or decrease in value, so buying either one involves risk. The difference is that most cryptocurrencies are notorious for drastic changes in value, and sometimes it happens without any clear reason. By comparison stokcs are directly linked to companies that must publicly and regularly share how they’ve been doing and how they expect to do in the future.</p><h1 id="which-currencies-are-more-volatile-and-which-ones-are-more-stable?">Which currencies are more volatile and which ones are more stable?</h1><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h1 id="fluctuations-and-predictions-of-crypto-currency-trends">Fluctuations and Predictions of Crypto-Currency Trends</h1><p>From here, we have seen trends in crypto-currency already, now we need to ask questions on why these trends happen and what factors we can look at to potentially be able to predic these trends. (For now, plots for Bitcoin and Dogeboin have been made with adjusted views of the axes, the goal is to make a multi-view visualization where I can select viewpoints of all the graphs at once).</p><div></div><div></div><h2 id="potential-causes-of-crypto-currency-trends">Potential Causes of Crypto-Currency Trends</h2><p>In order to fully understand the rises and drops in crypto-currencies, the charts and data can reveal the many events that occured that have caused these trends. For example, a trend these cryptocurrencies have is the major decline in January of 2018 which gives us a timeframe to research. Among other factors, the disclosure of the <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/01/29/technology/coincheck-cryptocurrency-exchange-hack-japan/index.html">2014 CoinCheck hack</a> along with general mainstream distaste for crypto-currency at this time. Smaller trends that can be discovered from the the visualization of Bitcoin is that the start and end of each April from 2016 and on show positive trends consistently.</p><p>Overall, the events that affect crypto-currencies are ongoing and very volatile, even as recent as May 8, 2021, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/08/dogecoin-price-plummets-as-elon-musk-hosts-saturday-night-live-.html">Elon Musk’s appearance on Saturday Night Live</a> caused a 30% drop in dogecoin due to the words he spoke on the crypto-currency.</p><h1 id="introduce-one-specific-crypto-currency:-bitcoin">Introduce one specific crypto-currency: Bitcoin</h1><p>In this section, we want to introduce one of the most famous cryto-currencies--Bitcoin.</p><p>Bitcoin began to be used in 2009 and the price has increased sharply in more than ten years.
But it is also well-known that the value of this currency is extremely volatile.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/gold_bitcoin/Sheet3?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="120%" height="600"></iframe><p>First of all, in order to get to know about Bitcoin, the trends of price is a very significant part to look at.
From the observation above, we can tell that the prices of Bitcoin increase over 1000 billion from 2017 to 2021.
And it increased over 800 billion from 2020 to 2021.</p><p>So how does price of Bitcoin compare to SPDR Gold Shares?</p><p>Also from this visualization, we can see that the prices of gold also increase a lot from 2017 to 2021 but it
does not increase as sharply as Bitcoin does. Therefore, Bitcoin is much more volatile since its prices are not stable.</p><div></div><div></div><p>Then, we want to focus on the trade volume of Bitcoin, that is, how much Bitcoin that people trade everyday,
it can tell how people actually use Bitcoin as currency.</p><p>From the visualization, as the increase of prices of Bitcoin, the trade volume increases as well. So, more people
buy and sell Bitcoin as the price increasing.</p></div><div class="idyll-scroll" id="idyll-scroll-0" style="position:relative"><div class="idyll-scroll-graphic" style="top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:auto;width:100%;transform:translate3d(0, 0, 0);z-index:-1;height:0"><div style="width:0;position:absolute;left:0;right:0;top:50%;transform:translateY(-50%)"><div><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/finalproject_16214143023760/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="80%" height="600"></iframe></div></div></div><div class=" idyll-text-container"><div class="idyll-scroll-text"><div class="idyll-step "><img src="./static/images/q1.png" alt="example width:&quot;120%&quot;"/></div></div></div></div><div class=" idyll-text-container"><span style="color:darkgreen;font-style:italic" idyll="[object Object]">
