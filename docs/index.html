It dates back to 2008 when Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous person, outlined the contents in a white paper, then releasing Bitcoin to the public in 2009. In the late 2010, other similar forms of cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin appeared as well.

Popular cryptocurrency soon began to be accepted as a legitimate method of payment.</p><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h1 id="how-is-crypto-currency-different-from-stocks?">How is crypto currency different from stocks?</h1><p>The primary different between cryptocurrency and stocks is that when you buy crypto, you own a certain amount of that digital currency. It may be possible to use Crypto in transactions as easily as other currencies in the near future, but today it’s primarily a store of value that you can hold onto or sell. Stocks on the other hand are offered by companies as equity or ownership in that company.</p><p>Both crypto and stocks can increase or decrease in value, so buying either one involves risk. The difference is that most cryptocurrencies are notorious for drastic changes in value, and sometimes it happens without any clear reason. By comparison stokcs are directly linked to companies that must publicly and regularly share how they’ve been doing and how they expect to do in the future.</p><h1 id="which-currencies-are-more-volatile-and-which-ones-are-more-stable?">Which currencies are more volatile and which ones are more stable?</h1><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h1 id="fluctuations-and-predictions-of-crypto-currency-trends">Fluctuations and Predictions of Crypto-Currency Trends</h1><p>From here, we have seen trends in crypto-currency already, now we need to ask questions on why these trends happen and what factors we can look at to potentially be able to predic these trends.

For example, a trend these cryptocurrencies have is the major decline in January of 2018 which gives us a timeframe to research. Among other factors, the disclosure of the <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/01/29/technology/coincheck-cryptocurrency-exchange-hack-japan/index.html">2014 CoinCheck hack</a> along with general mainstream distaste for crypto-currency at this time. Smaller trends that can be discovered from the the visualization of Bitcoin is that the start and end of each April from 2016 and on show positive trends consistently.</p><p>Overall, the events that affect crypto-currencies are ongoing and very volatile, even as recent as May 8, 2021, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/08/dogecoin-price-plummets-as-elon-musk-hosts-saturday-night-live-.html">Elon Musk’s appearance on Saturday Night Live</a> caused a 30% drop in dogecoin due to the words he spoke on the crypto-currency.</p><h1 id="introduce-one-specific-crypto-currency:-bitcoin">Introduce one specific crypto-currency: Bitcoin</h1><div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div>
